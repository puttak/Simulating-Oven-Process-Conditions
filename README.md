# Simulating-Oven-Process-Conditions
As students of the Final Year Project Team, our project involved Process Development and Simulation of a Bread Manufacturing Plant. As a Chemical Engineer, my focus was to implement proper process selection and developing the process flow diagram. Apart from that, I was instrumental in simulating the Temperature profile of the Bread Oven, in addition to the Moisture Content of the Bread. Sufficient focus was also stressed upon Chemical Project Economics and Site Selection.
